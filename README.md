### Disclaimer
`Makefile` DESTRUCTIVELY removes all existing dotfiles and symlinks related dotfile defined in this repository. I
recommend that you review the `Makefile` before installing.

installed.

### Credits
Configurations are heavily inspired by [martin-svk/dot-files](https://github.com/martin-svk/dot-files).
Extending from his work, I have made significant changes to most of the settings to accomodate the OS X (since his configurations were mainly meant for linux distros).
