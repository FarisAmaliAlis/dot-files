## â˜¢  dot-files
My current (and ever-changing) development toolkit settings.

Settings here are heavily inspired by [martin-svk/dot-files](https://github.com/martin-svk/dot-files).
Extending from his work, I have made significant changes to most of the settings to accomodate the OS X (since his configurations were mainly meant for linux distros).
